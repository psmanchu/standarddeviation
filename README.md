# Standard Deviation



Standard Deviation (σ) in statistics, typically denoted by σ, is a measure of how much a data set varies (dispersion) between values in a set of data. The lower the standard deviation, the closer the data points tend to be to the mean (or expected value), μ. In this lab, we will demonstrate how to calculate the standard deviation.





Here are the steps to calculate the standard deviation of a data set:



1. Calculate the mean (average) of the data set:



2\. Calculate the squared differences from the mean for each data point:



3\. Calculate the average of these squared differences (variance):



4\. Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation:



For example, if the data set is 4,6,8,10



Step 1 - Average is (4+6+8+10) = 28/4 = 7

Step 2 - Squared differences = (4-7)square + (6-7)square + (8-7)square + (10-7)square = 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 = 20

Step 3 - Variance = 20/4 = 5

Step 4 - Standard Deviation = Square root of 5 = 2.236



The standard deviation of the example dataset (4,6,8,10) is 2.236.
